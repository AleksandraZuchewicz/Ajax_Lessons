 # What is AJAX! 

Ajax is a developer's dream, because you can: 

 - Read data from the web server - after a web page has loaded, 
 - Update a web page without relading the page, 
 - Send data to a web server - in the background. 

AJAX is not a programming language, is a technique for accesing web servers from a web page. 
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JS and XML. 
AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
AJAX is not a programming language.


**AJAX just uses a combination of:**

A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.

AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page,
without reloading the whole page.
